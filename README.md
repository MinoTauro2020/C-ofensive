# C-ofensive

I will be sharing my progress and advancements in C++ programming for offensive tactics. This repository is dedicated to exploring various techniques and strategies related to offensive cybersecurity, penetration testing, and exploit development. By sharing my code and projects, I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity community and foster knowledge exchange.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the projects, and provide feedback. Together, let's enhance our skills in C++ and develop innovative offensive tactics in the field of cybersecurity.

Note: It's important to adhere to ethical guidelines and legal boundaries while conducting any activities related to offensive tactics. Always ensure that you are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
